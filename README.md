# The-Doubly-Excited-S-States
EXACT MOLECULAR MODEL TO DESCRIBE THE DOUBLY EXCITED S STATES OF ATOMS WITH TWO ELECTRONS.

This repository contains Wolfram Mathematica notebooks developed to study and implement an exact molecular model for describing the doubly excited S states of helium (He) and the hydride (H‚Åª). The model is based on the Conditional-Marginal Factorization formalism, providing a detailed and accurate approach to these systems.
